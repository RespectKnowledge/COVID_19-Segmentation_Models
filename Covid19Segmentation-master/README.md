# Covid19Segmentation

1- Main workspace is in colab, just upload SSIProject.ipynb in your colab.<br>
2- We built the proposed Dense model by this paper<br>
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S136184151830848X?via%3Dihub.<br>
you can apply the training going to cell (
Fully convolutional multi-scale residual DenseNetsÂ¶
) in colab.<br>
3- If you want to load the already trained model, you can find the saved file in ModelsData/DenseModel/ and to load it  <br>
(Go to load existing model cell and change the path file to yours and then start testing). and load the Main Dense model. 

we could not upload the other pretrained models we tested because of large size.\
